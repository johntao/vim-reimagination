- [x] add text in the background. text aware cursor motion
- Motion
  - resolve word-based motions
    - [x] d, f first implementation
    - [x] a, s, d, f first implementation
    - [x] d needs to be fixed
      - prefer symmetrical algorithm over ad-hoc algorithm
    - [x] word wrap
    - [x] buffer boundary
    - [x] big word motion
    - [x] buffer should not mix with motion algorithm, buffer should not store Cursor2D
    - [x] useQwerty, useDvorak, useCustom
    - [ ] fix a bug where we cannot set YourChoice again
    - [ ] fix a bug where double exclaimation mark is not working
    - [ ] enhance the mapping algorithm so that users NO NEEDS to use arrow keys
    - [ ] make status bar more informative
      - text-object algorithm
- Base framework
  - [ ] get current line number
  - [ ] I wonder if it would be better to use raw literal string for Console.WriteLine
  - [ ] add config to decide whether to move cursor to nextline on hitting the edge
    - I think this is SUPER trivial, no need to waste extra keystrokes for this
    - we need to save keystrokes whenever possible... (precious keystrokes...)
  - [ ] copy template during build process
  - [ ] remove text in the background
  - [ ] algorithm to fill in empty spaces...
  - [ ] resolve newlines
  - [ ] resolve different buffer types
  - [ ] yank, putReplace
  - [ ] editable: replace, delete, change
  - [ ] set up boundaries for status bar, motion and rendering
- Advanced framework
  - [ ] should be able to scroll
  - [ ] virtual boundary
  - [ ] editable: insert
  - [ ] putInsert
  - [ ] undo, redo, search, save, quit
  - [ ] IHasRegister
  - [ ] Multiple cursors
  - [ ] IHasHistory
  - [ ] visual mode
- Advanced Hotkey Trigger or Accessibility
  - [ ] resolve multiple key press
  - [ ] resolve multiple key inputs
  - [ ] flash visual
- Vision
  - remove ex command while keeping all the capacity
  - support any kinds of keyboard layout
  - should be able to run on any platform
    - hence, the API should be platform agnostic
    - beaware if platform doesn't support Console.Left, Console.Top
    - should at least migrate to Terminal.Gui
    - afterward, we might have better support for migration to other platforms
    - probably, the best way to do this is to develop with lower level API
