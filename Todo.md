- Easy tasks (can be done in a day)
  - Command key mapping
    - [x] useQwerty, useDvorak, useCustom
    - [x] fix a bug where we cannot set YourChoice again
    - [x] fix a bug where double exclaimation mark is not working binding
    - [x] enhance the mapping algorithm so that users NO NEEDS to use arrow keys
  - Console/ Buffer data binding and rendering
    - [x] add text in the background. text aware cursor motion
    - [x] buffer should not mix with motion algorithm, buffer should not store Cursor2D
    - [x] buffer boundary
    - [x] algorithm to fill in empty spaces (make the buffer reflect to the window size)
    - [ ] remove text in the background
    - [ ] resolve newlines
    - [ ] resolve different buffer types
  - Motion
    - word-based motions
      - [x] d, f first implementation
      - [x] a, s, d, f first implementation
      - [x] d needs to be fixed
        - prefer symmetrical algorithm over ad-hoc algorithm
      - [x] move cursor one unit up or down when hitting the edge
      - [x] big word motion
    - text-object algorithm
    - ternary IRepeatable
      - [ ] !!implement IRepeatable for a,s,d,f,q,w,e,r
  - Configurable
    - [ ] add config to decide whether to move cursor to nextline on hitting the edge
      - since this is SUPER trivial, no need to waste extra keystrokes for this feature
      - we need to save keystrokes whenever possible... (precious keystrokes...)
  - HUD
    - [ ] make status bar more informative
    - [ ] get current line number
    - [ ] set up boundaries for status bar, motion and rendering
  - Refactor (engineering factor)
    - [x] Use dependency injection. abstract Console
    - [x] copy template during build process
    - [x] I wonder if it would be better to use raw literal string for Console.WriteLine
  - Editable
    - [ ] yank, putReplace
    - [ ] !!editable: replace, delete, change
  - Other Core Stuff
    - [x] !!Save/ Load file
- Medium tasks (can be done in a few days)
  - Console/ Buffer data binding and rendering
    - [ ] should be able to scroll
    - [ ] virtual cursor position
  - Editable
    - [ ] insert
    - [ ] putInsert
    - [ ] undo, redo, search, save, quit
  - Universal command attribute
    - [ ] IHasRegister
    - [ ] IHasHistory
  - Other Core Stuff
    - [ ] visual mode
- Hard tasks (can be done in a month or more or years...)
  - Other Core Stuff
    - [ ] Multiple cursors
  - Advanced Hotkey Trigger or Accessibility
    - [ ] resolve multiple key press
    - [ ] resolve multiple key inputs
    - [ ] flash visual
  - Refactor (engineering factor)
    - remove ex command while keeping all the capacity
    - support any kinds of keyboard layout
      - CharaChorder One 3-D switches (5-wayÂ tactile)
    - support non-keyboard input
      - mouse, touchpad, touch screen, voice, gesture, eye tracking, brainwave
    - should be able to run on any platform
      - hence, the API should be platform agnostic
      - beaware if a platform doesn't support Console.Left, Console.Top
      - after the first migration, we might have better support to migrate more platforms
      - or, we could delve into lower level API of a specific platform, to gain some experience
      - [ ] migrate to Terminal.Gui
      - [ ] use Windows API to leverage advanced Console features
